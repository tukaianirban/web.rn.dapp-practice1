Vite (vitejs.dev) is a tooling service that helps to create, init React faster and leaner.


Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework with prebuilt classes that are used to build webpages.
Simply put, you do not need to create css class; they are all built in.
After init, get your configurations in place with the configs under: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app
If you need to understand any property used, just search for the string in the tailwind docs.
If some component is missing out in tailwind, install it this way: # npm install -D @tailwindcss/forms 



In this project we use npm install for installing new packages, and yarn for adding and removing packages 
(already installed in node_modules/) to our repo (yarn.lock).
Alternatively, use ' npm add <package name> ' for adding the package into package-lock.json

# npx hardhat -> initializes the project with tests/, contracts/, hardhat.config.js files.

to Validate whether the installation / initialisation was done right or not, run the base (example) tests:
# npx hardhat test

The Solidity extension for VS Code provides code highlighting and makes it easier to write.

Vite (vitejs.dev) is a tooling service that helps to create, init React faster and leaner.


Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework with prebuilt classes that are used to build webpages.
Simply put, you do not need to create css class; they are all built in.
After init, get your configurations in place with the configs under: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app
If you need to understand any property used, just search for the string in the tailwind docs.

In this project we use npm install for installing new packages, and yarn for adding and removing packages 
(already installed in node_modules/) to our repo (yarn.lock).
Alternatively, use ' npm add <package name> ' for adding the package into package-lock.json
